### Holla

My name's Yaroslav, but you can also call me Ray (if we are friends and my name pronunciation makes you suffer :) ).

I'm currenlty learning front-end web development, espessially a11y and best practices.
I like convenient and beautiful websites and want to be able doing another one by myself. Also I want to expand my skills in SPA, animation and WebGL.

I like [HTML Academy](https://htmlacademy.ru/) education quality and development standarts.
I finished:
- HTML –∏ CSS, —É—Ä–æ–≤–µ–Ω—å 1;
- HTML –∏ CSS, —É—Ä–æ–≤–µ–Ω—å 2;
- JavaScript, —É—Ä–æ–≤–µ–Ω—å 1;
- JavaScript, —É—Ä–æ–≤–µ–Ω—å 2 (not successfully);
- JavaScript, —É—Ä–æ–≤–µ–Ω—å 3 (not successfully);
